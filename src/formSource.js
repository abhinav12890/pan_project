This method uses two current electrodes situated at the end points with the two measuring electrodes continuously spreading in the line. This yields depth-wise resistivity variations, which are interpreted in terms of aquifer aquitards at depth and salinity of water in the aquifers. The field measurements technique is adjustable for the different topographic conditions and the interpretation of the data can be done with specialized software, with a primary interpretation immediately after the measurements.',

Measured decay times, which are used to estimate subsurface hydrogeologic properties, are sometimes influenced by the presence of magnetic minerals. At this field site, T2* decay times from FID measurements were found to be very short (~15-50 ms), initially suggesting that groundwater was bound in low permeability silts. Supplemental spin echo measurements, however, revealed that the T2 decay times were actually much longer (~100-400 ms). While FID measurements were strongly affected by the magnetic geology, robust spin echo measurements accurately reflected the high permeability of the shallow sand and gravel aquifer.',

Afterward, experiments were carried out in the field to investigate the geophysical strata below the surface of the soil using both ground magnetic resonance (GMR) and resistivity meter. The measured geophysical strata from GMR and resistivity meter are compared with borehole data. It is observed that the results obtained by GMR and resistivity meter of aquifer strata are matching with borehole data. Hence, it is shown that GMR measurements are more economical, time-saving and non-invasive. Finally, the measured hydraulic conductivity can have potential application in the modeling of flow through subsurface soil.',
